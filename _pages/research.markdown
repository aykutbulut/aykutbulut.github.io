I am interested in computing, from the basic [theory of
computability][comp-theory] to computational complexity and all the way up
to modern software engineering practices. Currently I work on [Chrome][chrome]
browser backend. Previously, I worked on [MATLAB Optimization
Toolbox][optim-toolbox] [intlinprog][intlinprog] solver and led the
development of [coneprog][coneprog] solver.

During grad school, I developed software to solve mixed integer second order
conic optimization problem (MISOCP). See my [github page][github-aykut] for my
projects.

Others

I worked on Sparse Inverse Covariance Selection problem as my
Optimization Methods in Machine Learning class project with [Murat Mut][murat-linkedin]. We
implemented a portion of algorithm proposed by [Scheinberg][scheinberg-coral] and Rish in
parallel. Here is our [report][sinco-report].

One of my Ph.D. qualifying exam questions was on Simple Assembly Line Balancing
Problem. You get get my report from [here][salbp-report] and 
[SALBP solver][salbp-solver] I wrote.
