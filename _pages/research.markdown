I am interested in computing, from the basic
[theory of computability][comp-theory] to computational complexity and to all the
way up to modern software engineering practices. I produce software to solve
discrete optimization problems. See my [github page][github-aykut] for my
projects.

Others

I worked on Sparse Inverse Covariance Selection problem as my
Optimization Methods in Machine Learning class project with [Murat Mut][murat-linkedin]. We
implemented a portion of algorithm proposed by [Scheinberg][scheinberg-coral] and Rish in
parallel. Here is our [report][sinco-report].
