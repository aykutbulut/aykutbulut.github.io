I am interested in computing, from the basic
[theoryofcomputability][comp-theory] to computational complexity and to all the
way up to modern software engineering practices. I produce software to solve
discrete optimization problems. See my [github page][github-aykut] for my
projects.


My advisor is Ted Ralphs. Currently I am working on discrete second order conic optimization, more on that will appear soon. I also worked on inverse optimization. Following is the related ISE Technical Report.

A. Bulut, T. Ralphs, On the Complexity of Inverse MILP, ISE Technical Report 15T-001, Lehigh University, March 2015.

Following is a list of presentations related to my work on inverse optimization.

A. Bulut, T. Ralphs, On the Complexity and Solution of Inverse Mixed Integer Linear Programs, INFORMS Annual Conference, Mineapolis, MN, October 2013.
T. Ralphs, A. Bulut, A. Lodi, F. Rossi, S. Smriglio, and G. Woeginger, Complexity and Multilevel Optimization, Mixed Integer Programming Workshop, UC Davis, July, 2012.
A. Bulut, T. Ralphs, An Algorithm for Solving Inverse Integer Programs, INFORMS Annual Conference, Phoenix, AZ, October 2012.

The following is the list of presentations related to GiMPy and GrUMPy.

T. Ralphs, A. Bulut, Michael O’Sullivan, Osman Ozaltin, GIMPy and GrUMPy: Visualization for Optimization in Python, INFORMS Annual Conference, Phoenix, AZ, October 2012.

I worked on Sparse Inverse Covariance Selection problem as my Optimization Methods in Machine Learning class project with Murat Mut. We implemented a portion of algorithm proposed by Scheinberg and Rish in parallel. Here is our report.

I worked on Simple Assembly Line Balancing Problems on my qualifier. I developed a solver for the problem using Pulp. Here is my report and you can find solver on software section.

I have completed my M.S. thesis titled “Order Driven Flexible Shop Management”. It is about management of make to order production systems. You can get it from here.
