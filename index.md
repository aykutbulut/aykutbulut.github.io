I am a software engineer at [Mathworks][mathworks]. I am a member of [COIN-OR
Foundation][coin-or-mainpage] and current maintainer of [DisCO
solver][disco-git] project. I recived my Ph.D. from [Industrial and Systems
Engineering][ise-lehigh] at [Lehigh University][lehigh] in 2018 under
supervision of [Ted Ralphs][ted-mainpage]. My thesis is on solving discrete
conic optimization problems. You can get a copy of my thesis from
[here][phd-thesis].
